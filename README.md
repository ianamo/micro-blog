# micro-blog

A super basic way to create a personal micro-blog, combining the functionality of Twitter or Instagram with React.js. To customize, you should fork the repo, edited the constants in the app.js, and then you can start adding posts (called "micra") to the file micra.js. Each micron is a JavaScript object with date and content fields. For the content, MarkDown is supported through react-markdown, so you can add links, images and other kinds of formatting with standard markdown syntax.
